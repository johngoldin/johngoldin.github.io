&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; session at the RStudio conference in Florida. I am enjoying the enthusiasm and energy around R and RStudio.
It reminds me of the early days of personal computers at the end of the 70&amp;rsquo;s and the beginning of the 80&amp;rsquo;s. Perhaps I am experiencing a second
childhood. Anyway, all the Cool Kids are doing web pages on GitHub so I want to do it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done some simple blog posts with Blogger and WordPress. One of my goals is to create a portfolio of the my R projects.
RMarkdown is the obvious way to go and WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly support
that. So that&amp;rsquo;s a motivation to use &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;. But really a bit part of the
motivation is that these days I am &amp;ldquo;all in&amp;rdquo; with the RStudio set of
tools so it&amp;rsquo;s natural to put my faith in Yihui Xie and jump in. Because &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; is still developing,
I know I am goint to suffer through rough edges. As a retiree, I am
doing this for fun so the rough edges just add to the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-pages&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a little trouble to start because I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the basics of
what was going on with GitHub and web pages. Here I am focused on what GitHub refers to as a &amp;ldquo;user site&amp;rdquo; (as opposed to an organization site or a project site). See their &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;general description of GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages&#34;&gt;What is GitHub Pages?&lt;/a&gt;. The key
fact is that if you have a repository called &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; (with your
GitHub username), whatever is in that repository will be served
as a web site accessed as &lt;code&gt;https://username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. What
we are going to do here is describe how to use &lt;strong&gt;markdown&lt;/strong&gt;, RStudio,
and GitHub to place the content of a static web site into
your &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site relies on &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; and GitHub. You have to have at least a beginner&amp;rsquo;s familiarity with GitHub, and believe me, I am merely a
GitHub beginner. I got my start with GitHub mostly based on information
from Jenny Bryan (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://happygitwithr.com/&#34;&gt;Happy Git and GitHub for the useR&lt;/a&gt;) and from &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; on the GitHub site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be able to create a repository on GitHub and then
clone that to a project in RStudio. See especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html&#34;&gt;section 16&lt;/a&gt; on Happy Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I try to operate in a way that allows me to rely on RStudio to do most of the work and to avoid doing git commands in the Terminal on OSX.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I create a minimal repository first on GitHub and then create
a new project in RStudio that clones the repository from GitHub. Rely on
Jenny&amp;rsquo;s directions on how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-a-website&#34;&gt;Creating a website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with blogdown, I relied on a post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/&#34;&gt;Amber Thomas&lt;/a&gt;,
especially the comments on the post by Yihui Xie, the creator of
&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;. Amber&amp;rsquo;s instructions involve more work with Git than I wanted
to attempt. In particular, she uses multiple branches. Instead,
I followed the suggestion and created two repositories.
One was for the site itself (&lt;code&gt;johngoldin.github.io&lt;/code&gt;) and the other (which I called &lt;code&gt;pages-source&lt;/code&gt;) contains the &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hugo&lt;/strong&gt; material
that actually produces the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository for username.github.io on your github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone that to a RStudio project with the same name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository on your github, any name you desire, but here we will calle it &lt;code&gt;hugo-source&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone that second project to an RStudio project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are going to use &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; to create a &lt;strong&gt;Hugo&lt;/strong&gt; site in
&lt;code&gt;hugo-source&lt;/code&gt;. And you are going to configure that site
so that whenever it builds a website, it will place that
website into the RStudio project username.github.io.
When you push username.github.io to GitHub you will in effect
publish your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Actually it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether or not you maintain
a GitHub repository for &lt;code&gt;hugo-source&lt;/code&gt;. It depends on whether
you want to use version control for convenience or backup, just
as would be true for any other RStudio project.)&lt;/p&gt;
