<p>I more or less disappeared from this site for more than a year. I&rsquo;m back. I dusted off the site and figured out how to move my site to <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>

<h3 id="netlify-and-blogdown">Netlify and Blogdown</h3>

<p>Adding Netlify to my setup was a bit tricky. It&rsquo;s always harder to do something when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.
I was a bit shaky on the relationship between Netlify and Github. When I was serving the site
via <code>johngoldin.github.io</code> I was using blogdown to create my site in a local
<code>public</code> folder and then using git to upload the contents of the <code>public</code> folder to
the johngoldin project on Github. With Netlify, I mirror my local blogdown repo with
the Github repo. But I do not need the contents of my local <code>public</code> folder. In fact,
I can add <code>public</code> to .gitignore.  I point Netlify at my Github blogdown repo and it knows
to use Hugo to process the site and build the <code>public</code> folder that it will serve on the
web. Very soon after I push my blogdown changes to Github, the final html site appears at Netlify.</p>

<p>There is an advantage and a disadvantage to this workflow. Before I would
build my site locally. Then I had to switch to the project that contained the <code>public</code> folder and push that to Github. With Netlify, after I push my local blogdown project to Github
my site is automatically rebuilt on Netlify. That saves a step. The disadvantage
is that pushing my blogdown project always updates my live blog site. I need to
check the site locally to see whether I am satisfied before doing a push to Github.
If I weren&rsquo;t paying for Netlify they would give me the ability to have a test site on
Netlify where I could explicitly decide when I was ready to publish to the live site.
Given that I have a readership of about one, that degree of control isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>I also went ahead and rented <a href="http://www.johngoldin.com">www.johngoldin.com</a> and told
Netlify to use it. So far the principal advantage I get from using Netlify is the ability
to redirect to a different place to serve my site. I suppose that renting johngoldin.com accomplishes something similar. OK, let&rsquo;s face it; I don&rsquo;t really have a good handle on why
Netlify is an advantage for someone like me. But Yihui <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/">recommends it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-now">What now?</h3>

<p>I have been doing a lot of bits and pieces of code at home. I plan to write up some of that here.
Given that I have been writing an occasional personal journal for most of life, the idea
of writing a blog that nobody reads doesn&rsquo;t seem strange to me. And maybe I will include
some useful bit that someone will actually discover via a Google search. A lot of the
tips that I have gotten on R (and sometimes on travel) have come from that kind of
writing.</p>
