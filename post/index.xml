      <title>This Site Has Moved!</title>

      <description>This Site Has Moved to https://www.johngoldin.com This site used to be served by GitHub Pages at johngoldin.github.io. No longer!
The new site is at Netlify. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m a cheapskate, I have sprung for the $10 per year to rent a domain name.
So the new site is:
https://www.johngoldin.com

      <title>I&#39;m Back</title>

      <description>I more or less disappeared from this site for more than a year. I&amp;rsquo;m back. I dusted off the site and figured out how to move my site to Netlify.
Netlify and Blogdown Adding Netlify to my setup was a bit tricky. It&amp;rsquo;s always harder to do something when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. I was a bit shaky on the relationship between Netlify and Github. When I was serving the site via johngoldin.</description>

      <title>Notes About This Site</title>

      <description>An earlier version of this blog was based on johngoldin.github.io. In July of 2018 I redid the blog so that it is hosted by Netlify and uses the name www.johngoldin.com. I had a lot of difficulty converting my old blogdown site. I ended up following Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s advice from her Happy Git book: I burned it down and started over. I created a new empty repo on GitHub and then cloned to an RStudio project on my Mac.</description>

      <title>American Walker in Britain Part 3</title>

      <description>Planning an Itinerary You have decided on where you are going to walk. Next you have to work out a detailed itinerary. For any trail covered by a Trailblazer book, it should contain a page that shows suggested itineraries for a relaxed, medium, or fast pace and for B&amp;amp;B&amp;rsquo;s, hostels or bunkhouses, and for camping. That produces a total of nine itineraries. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you are walking from B&amp;amp;B to B&amp;amp;B (rather than camping or a tour where some transport is provided).</description>

      <description>Choosing a Path Obviously choosing a path is a matter of personal taste. In the first post I included some links where you could find ideas on where to walk. I&amp;rsquo;ll lay out some concrete possibilities here, just to get you started. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this as a prescriptive list.
Would you prefer walking on the coast or in the hills? If a multi-day route along beautiful seacoast appeals to you then the obvious possibilities are the South West Coast Path in Devon and Cornwall or the Pembrokeshire Coast Path in Wales.</description>

      <title>An American Walking in Britain</title>

      <description>Since retiring in 2011, I have been on a binge of walking in the UK. I will try to offer some tips based on lessons I have learned. I doubt this would be of any use to someone raised in the UK. Much of what I would say here would be obvious or second nature. But lots of things weren&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me as an American and therefore a foreigner unfamiliar with the British countryside.</description>

      <title>An Implementation of Narcissism in R</title>
      <link>/2017/02/26/an-implementation-of-narcissism-in-r/</link>

      <guid>/2017/02/26/an-implementation-of-narcissism-in-r/</guid>
      <description>This post is more an example of narcissism, but implementation has a nice technical ring to it.
Narcissism hasn’t been part of my every-day vocabulary, although it has been in the news recently. Lately we have been seeing discussions about narcissistic personality disorder, but that is not what I am talking about here. At least I hope not, because I’m talking about me.
Here’s the definition that fits this post:</description>

      <title>Portfolio of Projects</title>
      <link>/2017/02/17/portfolio/</link>

      <guid>/2017/02/17/portfolio/</guid>
      <description>One motivation for creating this blog was to display a portfolio of projects that I have worked on in the last year or so. I&amp;rsquo;ll list projects here. The plan is that eventually I will add pages that elaborate each project. I hope that publishing my projects on this site will nudge me to be a bit more systematic as I execute projects.
The Diary of Samuel Pepys Each morning I read an entry from The Diary of Samuel Pepys at a wonderful site created by Phil Gyford.</description>

      <title>How I Set Up This Site</title>

      <description>I attended the blogdown session at the RStudio conference in Florida. I am enjoying the enthusiasm and energy around R and RStudio. It reminds me of the early days of personal computers at the end of the 70&amp;rsquo;s and the beginning of the 80&amp;rsquo;s. Perhaps I am experiencing a second childhood. Anyway, all the Cool Kids are doing web pages on GitHub so I want to do it too.</description>

      <title>Using the Flickr API from R</title>
      <link>/2016/07/03/using-the-flickr-api-from-r/</link>

      <guid>/2016/07/03/using-the-flickr-api-from-r/</guid>
      <description>There used to be an Rflickr package, but it no longer seems to work. It was last updated in 2011. I had a lot of trouble googling information on how to access Flickr from R. This example really got me started. It is doing very different things that what I wanted to do, so it may be more useful than what I am laying out here, depending on your goal.</description>

      <title>Technical Note--Shiny Souvenir Map of Walks</title>
      <link>/2016/06/28/walks_map_notes/</link>

      <guid>/2016/06/28/walks_map_notes/</guid>
      <description>I have used RStudio’s Shiny to create a map page where I can display GPS traces and photos from walks I have done during the last five years.
The map is based on an example provided by Maarten Hermans in a blog post that he published last year. The map uses R htmlwidgets that provide access to the Javascript tool Leaflet. The trick is that I don’t have to know very much about either htmlwidgets or Leaflet to make this work.</description>
