<p>I attended the <strong>blogdown</strong> session at the RStudio conference in Florida. I am enjoying the enthusiasm and energy around R and RStudio.
It reminds me of the early days of personal computers at the end of the 70&rsquo;s and the beginning of the 80&rsquo;s. Perhaps I am experiencing a second
childhood. Anyway, all the Cool Kids are doing web pages on GitHub so I want to do it too.</p>

<p>I have done some simple blog posts with Blogger and WordPress. One of my goals is to create a portfolio of the my R projects.
RMarkdown is the obvious way to go and WordPress doesn&rsquo;t directly support
that. So that&rsquo;s a motivation to use <strong>blogdown</strong>. But really a bit part of the
motivation is that these days I am &ldquo;all in&rdquo; with the RStudio set of
tools so it&rsquo;s natural to put my faith in Yihui Xie and jump in. Because <strong>blogdown</strong> is still developing,
I know I am goint to suffer through rough edges. As a retiree, I am
doing this for fun so the rough edges just add to the adventure.</p>

<h3 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>I had a little trouble to start because I didn&rsquo;t understand the basics of
what was going on with GitHub and web pages. Here I am focused on what GitHub refers to as a &ldquo;user site&rdquo; (as opposed to an organization site or a project site). See their <a href="https://pages.github.com/">general description of GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages">What is GitHub Pages?</a>. The key
fact is that if you have a repository called <code>username.github.io</code> (with your
GitHub username), whatever is in that repository will be served
as a web site accessed as <code>https://username.github.io</code>. What
we are going to do here is describe how to use <strong>markdown</strong>, RStudio,
and GitHub to place the content of a static web site into
your <code>username.github.io</code> repository.</p>

<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>

<p>The site relies on <strong>blogdown</strong> and GitHub. You have to have at least a beginner&rsquo;s familiarity with GitHub, and believe me, I am merely a
GitHub beginner. I got my start with GitHub mostly based on information
from Jenny Bryan (see <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</a>) and from <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN">RStudio</a>. There&rsquo;s also an <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">introduction</a> on the GitHub site.</p>

<p>You need to be able to create a repository on GitHub and then
clone that to a project in RStudio. See especially <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html">section 16</a> on Happy Git.</p>

<p>In general I try to operate in a way that allows me to rely on RStudio to do most of the work and to avoid doing git commands in the Terminal on OSX.
That&rsquo;s why I create a minimal repository first on GitHub and then create
a new project in RStudio that clones the repository from GitHub. Rely on
Jenny&rsquo;s directions on how to do that.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-website">Creating a website</h3>

<p>To get started with blogdown, I relied on a post by <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/">Amber Thomas</a>,
especially the comments on the post by Yihui Xie, the creator of
<strong>blogdown</strong>. Amber&rsquo;s instructions involve more work with Git than I wanted
to attempt. In particular, she uses multiple branches. Instead,
I followed the suggestion and created two repositories.
One was for the site itself (<code>johngoldin.github.io</code>) and the other (which I called <code>pages-source</code>) contains the <strong>blogdown</strong> and <strong>Hugo</strong> material
that actually produces the site.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a repository for username.github.io on your github.</li>
<li>Clone that to a RStudio project with the same name.</li>
<li>Create a repository on your github, any name you desire, but here we will calle it <code>hugo-source</code>.</li>
<li>Clone that second project to an RStudio project.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are going to use <strong>blogdown</strong> to create a <strong>Hugo</strong> site in
<code>hugo-source</code>. And you are going to configure that site
so that whenever it builds a website, it will place that
website into the RStudio project username.github.io.
When you push username.github.io to GitHub you will in effect
publish your website.</p>

<p>(Actually it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not you maintain
a GitHub repository for <code>hugo-source</code>. It depends on whether
you want to use version control for convenience or backup, just
as would be true for any other RStudio project.)</p>
