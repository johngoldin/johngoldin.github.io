      I more or less disappeared from this site for more than a year. I&rsquo;m back. I dusted off the site and figured out how to move my site to Netlify.
Netlify and Blogdown Adding Netlify to my setup was a bit tricky. It&rsquo;s always harder to do something when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. I was a bit shaky on the relationship between Netlify and Github. When I was serving the site via johngoldin.

      An earlier version of this blog was based on johngoldin.github.io. In July of 2018 I redid the blog so that it is hosted by Netlify and uses the name www.johngoldin.com. I had a lot of difficulty converting my old blogdown site. I ended up following Jenny Bryan&rsquo;s advice from her Happy Git book: I burned it down and started over. I created a new empty repo on GitHub and then cloned to an RStudio project on my Mac.

      Planning an Itinerary You have decided on where you are going to walk. Next you have to work out a detailed itinerary. For any trail covered by a Trailblazer book, it should contain a page that shows suggested itineraries for a relaxed, medium, or fast pace and for B&amp;B&rsquo;s, hostels or bunkhouses, and for camping. That produces a total of nine itineraries. I&rsquo;m assuming you are walking from B&amp;B to B&amp;B (rather than camping or a tour where some transport is provided).

      Choosing a Path Obviously choosing a path is a matter of personal taste. In the first post I included some links where you could find ideas on where to walk. I&rsquo;ll lay out some concrete possibilities here, just to get you started. Don&rsquo;t take this as a prescriptive list.
Would you prefer walking on the coast or in the hills? If a multi-day route along beautiful seacoast appeals to you then the obvious possibilities are the South West Coast Path in Devon and Cornwall or the Pembrokeshire Coast Path in Wales.

      Since retiring in 2011, I have been on a binge of walking in the UK. I will try to offer some tips based on lessons I have learned. I doubt this would be of any use to someone raised in the UK. Much of what I would say here would be obvious or second nature. But lots of things weren&rsquo;t obvious to me as an American and therefore a foreigner unfamiliar with the British countryside.

      This post is more an example of narcissism, but implementation has a nice technical ring to it.
Narcissism hasn’t been part of my every-day vocabulary, although it has been in the news recently. Lately we have been seeing discussions about narcissistic personality disorder, but that is not what I am talking about here. At least I hope not, because I’m talking about me.
Here’s the definition that fits this post:

      One motivation for creating this blog was to display a portfolio of projects that I have worked on in the last year or so. I&rsquo;ll list projects here. The plan is that eventually I will add pages that elaborate each project. I hope that publishing my projects on this site will nudge me to be a bit more systematic as I execute projects.
The Diary of Samuel Pepys Each morning I read an entry from The Diary of Samuel Pepys at a wonderful site created by Phil Gyford.

      I attended the blogdown session at the RStudio conference in Florida. I am enjoying the enthusiasm and energy around R and RStudio. It reminds me of the early days of personal computers at the end of the 70&rsquo;s and the beginning of the 80&rsquo;s. Perhaps I am experiencing a second childhood. Anyway, all the Cool Kids are doing web pages on GitHub so I want to do it too.

      There used to be an Rflickr package, but it no longer seems to work. It was last updated in 2011. I had a lot of trouble googling information on how to access Flickr from R. This example really got me started. It is doing very different things that what I wanted to do, so it may be more useful than what I am laying out here, depending on your goal.
