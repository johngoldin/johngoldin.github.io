      <description>An earlier version of this blog was based on johngoldin.github.io. In July of 2018 I redid the blog so that it is hosted by Netlify and uses the name www.johngoldin.com. I had a lot of difficulty converting my old blogdown site. I ended up following Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s advice from her Happy Git book: I burned it down and started over. I created a new empty repo on GitHub and then cloned to an RStudio project on my Mac.</description>

      <description>I attended the blogdown session at the RStudio conference in Florida. I am enjoying the enthusiasm and energy around R and RStudio. It reminds me of the early days of personal computers at the end of the 70&amp;rsquo;s and the beginning of the 80&amp;rsquo;s. Perhaps I am experiencing a second childhood. Anyway, all the Cool Kids are doing web pages on GitHub so I want to do it too.</description>
