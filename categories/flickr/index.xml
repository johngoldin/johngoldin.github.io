      <description>There used to be an Rflickr package, but it no longer seems to work. It was last updated in 2011. I had a lot of trouble googling information on how to access Flickr from R. This example really got me started. It is doing very different things that what I wanted to do, so it may be more useful than what I am laying out here, depending on your goal.</description>

      <title>Technical Note--Shiny Souvenir Map of Walks</title>

      <description>I have used RStudio’s Shiny to create a map page where I can display GPS traces and photos from walks I have done during the last five years.
The map is based on an example provided by Maarten Hermans in a blog post that he published last year. The map uses R htmlwidgets that provide access to the Javascript tool Leaflet. The trick is that I don’t have to know very much about either htmlwidgets or Leaflet to make this work.</description>
