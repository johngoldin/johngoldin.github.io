&lt;h2 id=&#34;choosing-a-path&#34;&gt;Choosing a Path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously choosing a path is a matter of personal taste. In the first
post I included some links where you could ideas on where to walk.
I&amp;rsquo;ll lay out some concrete possibilities here, just to get you started.
Don&amp;rsquo;t take this as a prescriptive list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you prefer walking on the coast or in the hills? If a multi-day route along beautiful seacoast appeals to you then the obvious possibilities are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/&#34;&gt;South West Coast Path&lt;/a&gt; in Devon and Cornwall or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/pembrokeshire-coast-path&#34;&gt;Pembrokeshire Coast Path&lt;/a&gt; in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;south-west-coast-path&#34;&gt;South West Coast Path&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South West Coast Path is 630 miles long so it&amp;rsquo;s not something you would tackle in one trip. One general piece of advice, is that when you are
planning where to go, look at the itineraries offered by some of the tour
companies. If a section of trail seems popular, there may be a good reason
for it. For my first trip to the South West Coast Path I saw a number of
tours that went from Padstow to St. Ives in Cornwall. A likely itinerary is
to do five stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Padstow to Treyarnon    
Treyanon to Newquay (pronounced new-key)    
Newquay to Perranporth    
Perranporth to Portreath    
Portreath to St. Ives    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/swcp2.png&#34;&gt;
In terms of accommodatoins there&amp;rsquo;s not much in Treyarnon besides the Youth Hostel (which looked very nice to me, at least from the outside).
One might get something in Porthcothan, a bit beyond Trearnon.
The route out of Padstow is around a peninsula called Trevose Head.
Padstow isn&amp;rsquo;t very far from Treyarnon because the direct
route cuts across the base of a peninsula.
It would be practical to take a bus or taxi out of Padstow to
Porthcothan and then walk back to Padstow. For the second day,
take the bus back out of Padstow to Porthcothan and then resume the walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this itinerary back in 2007. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice walk, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s quite
popular. Both St. Ives and Padstow are substantial towns that attract a
lot of holiday visitors. St. Ives is know for the Tate Gallery there and Padstow
is know for fine dining because of restauranteur &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Stein&#34;&gt;Rick Stein&lt;/a&gt;. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know who
Rick Stein is and I don&amp;rsquo;t know about galleries, so if you are
craving information about food or art you are in the wrong place. On both
of my trips to Padstow I stayed at the London Inn and dined on pub food. I didn&amp;rsquo;t starve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of the British TV show Doc Martin then by all means start
your trip in Port Isaac, a day to the east of Padstow and the real life
location for the fictional village of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-02-27/where-is-doc-martin-filmed-martin-clunes-guide-to-port-isaac&#34;&gt;Portwenn&lt;/a&gt;.
Port Isaac is even more quaint and charming in person than it appears in the TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/swcp_map_sign.png&#34;&gt;
Given the length of the South West Coast Path, there are lots of other
possibilities. The northern section at the start of the walk
from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/walk-coast-path/walking-breaks/3-5-day-breaks/minehead-combe-martin/&#34;&gt;Minehead to Combe Martin or Ilfracombe&lt;/a&gt; also seems to be popular.
It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful coastal walk at the north end of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/&#34;&gt;Exmoor National Park&lt;/a&gt;.
The terrain is much more rugged than the section from Padstow to St. Ives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pembrokeshire-coast-path&#34;&gt;Pembrokeshire Coast Path&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;www.nationaltrail.co.uk/pembrokeshire-coast-path&#34;&gt;Pembrokeshire Coast Path&lt;/a&gt; in Wales is another popular choice.
I have only done a section north of St. Davids and a walk inland from
Newport farther up the coast. So I can&amp;rsquo;t offer much in the way of practical
advice on the itinerary, other than to say I found both
&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/pembrokeshire_path.png&#34;&gt;
St. Davids and Newport to be pleasant spots. Ah, I do have one very
practica tip. There is more than one Newport in Wales. The larger
Newport is a substantial city in southeastern Wales not so far
from Cardiff. That&amp;rsquo;s not the one you want. But there is a smaller, picturesque coastal village called Newport
in Pembrokeshire on the Coast Path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;west-highland-way&#34;&gt;West Highland Way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/home.asp&#34;&gt;West Highland Way&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular routes. It starts north of Glasgow and goes for
96 miles to Fort William, passing the base of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ben-nevis.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Nevis&lt;/a&gt;, the highest peak in the British Isles
The highlights of the walk are Loch Lomond and the beautiful valley of Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ye&#39;ll tak&#39; the high road and I&#39;ll tak the low road
And I&#39;ll be in Scotland afore ye
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the route were originally a military road
connecting to Fort William, which was a base for the
pacification of the Highlands after the rebellion of 1745.
Later is was a route for driving cattle down out of the Highlands
to market in Glasgow and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked this route in 1998 on a self-guide tour arranged by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sherpavan.com/trails/west_highland_way.asp&#34;&gt;Sherpa&lt;/a&gt;.
I have great memories of leaving Kingshouse in Glencoe and
walking up the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Staircase to the highest point on the path
and a spectacular view of the valley below. And I remember being tired and footsore by the time I reached my bed in Kinlochleven, but that&amp;rsquo;s all
part of the experience.
In 2011 I drove through Glencoe with my sisters and it
was a very different experience from walking the same valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-coast-to-coast-path&#34;&gt;The Coast to Coast Path&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sherpaexpeditions.com/Coast-to-Coast&#34;&gt;The Coast to Coast Path&lt;/a&gt; is not an offical route like the others, but
it is very popular. My impression is that it had a higher
proportion of non-British walkers than the other routes, although that may
be true of the West Highland Way as well. The route passes through
the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales Natoinal Park, and the North York
Moors National Park.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:National-Parks-i&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:National-Parks-i&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 2012 I walked this path from St. Bees to Richmond.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good introduction to the Lake District, but includes the different
landscape of North Yorkshire farther east. The variety of landscape is one of
the attractions of the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/beachy_head_lighthouse.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-south-downs-way&#34;&gt;The South Downs Way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/south-downs-way/be-inspired&#34;&gt;The South Downs Way&lt;/a&gt; in southern England is not so very far from London. I have walked the last nine mile stretch into Eastbourne. That is a magnificent walk, but very unlike
the rest of the walk. Based on what I have read, this could be a very
nice walk with convenient access and forgiving terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An American Walking in Britain</title>
      <link>/2017/03/07/an-american-walking-in-britain/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/03/07/an-american-walking-in-britain/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since retiring in 2011, I have been on a binge of walking in the UK. I will try to offer some tips based on lessons I have learned.
I doubt this would be of any use to someone raised in the UK. Much of what I would say here would be obvious or second nature.
But lots of things weren&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me as an American and therefore a foreigner unfamiliar with the British countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example right at the outset, compare the words &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo;. In the
US we use the word &amp;ldquo;hike&amp;rdquo; a lot. My impression is that &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo; is not the usual term
in England. Instead one refers to &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo;. In America, &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; implies a short ramble. In the UK one has the hard-core &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ldwa.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Long Distance Walkers Association&lt;/a&gt;. Their idea of a good time starts
with about 50 miles in a day. Or a more human-scaled example would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walkingenglishman.com/&#34;&gt;The Walking Englishman&lt;/a&gt; web site, a great source
of information. In these notes and tips I will try to use English terminology
(based on my imperfect knowledge) and so I will
refer to &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-walking-in-britain&#34;&gt;Why Walking in Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once while chatting with a local walker on the top of some barren fell,
&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I have been asked why I have come all the way to England to do my walking.
Surely there is plenty of opportunity back in the US. What about the Appalachian Trail? Good question. On a number of multi-mile trudges across boggy moorland I have had plenty of opportunity to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a great infrastructure for walking, both short and long distances.
&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/finger_pointer.png&#34;&gt;
One frequently see the ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;public footpath&amp;rdquo; finger posts marking some local public &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_way&#34;&gt;right of way&lt;/a&gt;. These footpaths originated as actual transportation routes.
There must have been quite a bit of that in colonial New England as well.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the legal and cultural circumstances that caused those right
of ways to be preserved in the UK. In modern times, the powerful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ramblers.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Ramblers Association&lt;/a&gt; functions somewhat like
the National Rifle Association, except for walking rather than guns. The Ramblers
lobby for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countryside_and_Rights_of_Way_Act_2000&#34;&gt;legislation favorable to walkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/pathwatch.aspx&#34;&gt;actively police&lt;/a&gt; existing
rights of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US hiking routes are associated with wilderness or less desirable land
that is away from populated areas. In the UK, because many paths grew out of
transportation routes, they often go from village to village. One consequence
of that is that in the US one has long distance routes such as
the Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail that emphasize being in
the wild and require camping. If wilderness is what you are after, long-settled England is not the place to find it. One might refer to the wild coast of
Cornwall on the South West Coast Path, but one is never very far away from a farm
or a village. One can feel far from the madding crowd in national parks such
as Dartmoor or Exmoor. It does feel a bit wild and isolated. But wilderness is
not the word that describes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an urbanized senior citizen such as myself, the creature comforts available in the UK are a big attraction. Even on the long distance routes one can walk from
village to village and stay in a cozy B&amp;amp;B, pub, or small hotel at the end of the day. One starts the day with a full English breakfast and follows a full day
of walking with a hot shower, a solid evening meal in the local pub, and finally
a comfortable bed (we hope). The type of walking I do in the UK is
fundamentally different from the Appalachian Trail. Plus there are no
bears or mountain lions or rattlesnakes to trouble my calm reflections
during the walk.
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;../../img/canopy_bed.png&#34; alt=&#34;Canopy Bed&#34; width=&#34;304&#34; height=&#34;228&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this better than camping?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another plus is public transportation, even away from cities and towns. If one wants to do a simple walk, it is often possible to take bus out
somewhere and walk back to your hotel. Here in Connecticut where I live,
there is a very nice set of trails (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails&#34;&gt;Blue Blazed Trails&lt;/a&gt;), but
almost none of them are near bus routes or motels or places to get food.
Invariably one has to drive to a trail head. That&amp;rsquo;s true for many foot paths in the UK as well, but there are also many that are available via public transportation.
&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/Port_Isaac_Shuttle.png&#34;&gt;
A couple of times I have decided to cut the day short and catch a bus for
the rest of the trip. Sometimes there are even simple ferries to get you across
an estuary. And even in rural areas there often is some sort of tax service available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other aspects of the UK that probably make a difference. There is less suburban sprawl and less dependece on cars. In my part of the world one does
not expect to find a motel or hotel anywhere except in a city or near a highway exit. In the UK B&amp;amp;B&amp;rsquo;s and small-scale hotels seem more plentiful. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to understand all the political, cultural, and legal factors that create those differences in
the environment. But the result is good for walkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll mention one other factor about the English landscape: sheep. I like sight lines. I enjoy walking through woods now and again, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so big on a full day of it.
I like to get out in the open and see a long distance. In the American West,
desert or altitude clear away the trees and give the hiker an unobstructed
view. I like that kind of walking. In ancient times Britain was covered in
forests. (Well, maybe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/planetearth/stories/608/&#34;&gt;not completely covered&lt;/a&gt;.)
In large swaths of Britain the land is kept clear of trees by grazing animals,
primarily sheep. Sometimes one will see a small stand of trees protected by
an old stone wall enclosing the grove. There are lots of wooded areas in the UK and perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m overstating things a bit.
But I associate areas like North Yorkshire with rolling green hills clear
of trees. In Connecticut a long walk invariably involves a walk in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, walking in the UK seems to be a much more visible and popular activity than hiking is in the US.
There are TV shows, books, guides, and maps in far greater volume than
in the US. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wainwright&#34;&gt;Alfred Wainwright&lt;/a&gt;
seems to be regarded as the the key figure in the modern popularity
of walking in Britain, especially the Lake District. He basically
invented the route for the Coast to Coast Path, which is one of the most
popular routes even though it is not one of the offical &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/&#34;&gt;National Trails&lt;/a&gt;.
There is a popular series of BBC programs by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A9U9y1LMNM&#34;&gt;Julia Bradbury&lt;/a&gt;
describing
Waintwright&amp;rsquo;s fell walks. The original &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Alfred-Wainwright/e/B001HPUBVK/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1489257346&amp;amp;sr=1-2-ent&#34;&gt;Wainwright guide books&lt;/a&gt; are
now somewhat out of date, but his enthusiasm is contagious and
his drawings are quite charming. If your local public library
has a copy, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other examples of the popularity of walking in Britain.
Julia Bradbury has a whole series of TV programs on walking including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRjhfaxOSyo&#34;&gt;Coast
to Coast Path&lt;/a&gt; and another on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96PUMMzARDo&#34;&gt;Best Walks&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX-ZBC_d80&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;list=PLwJ3dKGiVfLKsZ5YVkkkIUrq28oC0bQHt&#34;&gt;railway walks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books extolling the pleasures of walking in Britain. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paddydillon.co.uk/guidebook/the-national-trails/&#34;&gt;The National Trails of England, Scotland and Wales&lt;/a&gt; by Paddy Dillon provides
a modern overview of each of the national trails with pictures, text, and
a map to orient you. A book which is significant for me is &lt;a href=&#34;The National 
Trust Book of Long Walks in England, Scotland and Wales&#34;&gt;The National
Trust Book of Long Walks in England, Scotland and Wales&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Nicolson with photographs by Charlie Waite.
This
book was my introduction to the long distance trails in Britain. After stumbling
on the existance of the Pennine Way in 1997, I wanted to know more and
found the National Trust book in the New Haven Public Library
after I returned home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it to Julia Bradbury and the authors of these books to
wax lyrical about the glories of British walking. In these notes
I will be much more prosaic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-walks&#34;&gt;Types of Walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trip I took to England was planned as a car trip around North Yorkshire.
But I quickly realized that if I went to the local tourist information center (TIC) there often was information about some local walks. I ended up doing a
number of half-day walks, including two that lay the ground work for
an enduring interest in walking in Britain. So mixing car touring with
walking is an entirely reasonable way to go. One one trip in Wales I arranged to stay for two nights in each of three places. That often worked out to be
a half day walk on the day I arrived and then a full-day of walking before
staying the second night. I started out with a two days in Wotton-under-Edge and a full-days&amp;rsquo;s walk on the Cotswold Way, two days in St. Davids in Wales and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and then two more nights in the northern half of
Wales. There are lots of areas where one could do something like that. With
a bit of planning, one could do something like that via bus or train and avoid
the car entirely (a big plus if one has qualms about driving on the left side of the road).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tour-companies&#34;&gt;Tour Companies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many companies that arrange walking holidays. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:More-language-is&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:More-language-is&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sherpaexpeditions.com/United-Kingdom&#34;&gt;Sherpa&lt;/a&gt; for a self-guided
tour on the West Highland Way. There are many others. A &amp;ldquo;self-guided&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; tour means that they will organize a route and accomodations, provide you with a map and
directions, and usually also arrange to transport your luggage. Guided tours mean that you walk with a group. The only group tour I have done was an REI tour in the United States walking rim to rim across the Grand Canyon. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have any expertise about organized tours. It&amp;rsquo;s a definite possibility, and well
worth your consideration. Just google &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;britain&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;England&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Scotland&amp;rdquo; and you will find a lot of options. An organized tour is a good way
to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also walking holidays that are organized out of a particular inn. You stay there for a period of time and each day your hosts arrange transportation to and from a walk for that day. This is not something I have any experience with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;camping&#34;&gt;Camping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve made it clear that camping is not my cup of tea, plenty of people
do make there way along the long-distance trails in Britain camping in much the
same way as Americans on the Appalachian or Pacific Coast Trails. It&amp;rsquo;s
not something I know anything about so all I can do is
acknowledge that it is a popular possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-day-walks&#34;&gt;Multi-day Walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the Sherpa-organized walk on the West Highland Way (almost twenty years ago)
I thought to myself that I could arrange that myself. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I have been
doing.
What I am hoping to do in these posts is to share some
practical advice on doing a multi-day walk in Britain.
Does it seem as though I am deliberately mystifying the whole process?
Not at all. The point I hope I have made is that there are lots of things in Britain that
come together to make a walking trip easy and satisfying.
And there is tons and tons of information available. Like
all travel activity, the web provides lots of ways to get
useful information. But if you are contemplating a trip on one of
England&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/&#34;&gt;National Trails&lt;/a&gt; or
other trails such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://ramblingman.org.uk/planningatrip/planning_a_coast_to_coast#s7&#34;&gt;The Coast to Coast Path&lt;/a&gt;
or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/home.asp&#34;&gt;West Highland Way&lt;/a&gt;,
buy a guide book. &lt;a href=&#34;https://trailblazer-guides.com/books&#34;&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/a&gt; seems to dominate
the market, at least for some trails in Britain. I have used a bunch of Trailblazer guides.
They have a similar style and organization although different authors.
They are loaded with very practical information including details about
route, accomodations, and services. They include useful hand drawn
maps of the route. Often you can find them on Amazon or other site in the US, but
you can also order them directly from Trailblazer. I just checked their web site
and I am shocked to see that they seem to offer free shipping world wide.
Of course there are other guide books available as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for general introduction.
What I aspire to do
in these posts is something like what &lt;a href=&#34;http://londonhiker.com/advice-and-tips/you-can-have-london-and-the-hills&#34;&gt;The London Hiker&lt;/a&gt; does
for the city-bound in London.
I will try to address particular topics and try to
include the kinds of details that I didn&amp;rsquo;t
know before my first walking holiday. Here&amp;rsquo;s the plan. Next step will be for me to fill this in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Planning an itinerary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arranging for accommodations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luggage transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to bring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rain (and how to cope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training, Fitness, and Foot Care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;A &amp;ldquo;fell&amp;rdquo; is a term primarily used in northern England or Scotland for a hill top. Often appears in place names such as Cross Fell.  See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walkingenglishman.com/&#34;&gt;fell running&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:More-language-is&#34;&gt;More language issues: they say &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; where we say &amp;ldquo;vacation&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:More-language-is&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
