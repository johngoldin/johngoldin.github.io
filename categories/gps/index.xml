      <description>I have used RStudio’s Shiny to create a map page where I can display GPS traces and photos from walks I have done during the last five years.
The map is based on an example provided by Maarten Hermans in a blog post that he published last year. The map uses R htmlwidgets that provide access to the Javascript tool Leaflet. The trick is that I don’t have to know very much about either htmlwidgets or Leaflet to make this work.</description>
