&lt;p&gt;Since retiring in 2011, I have been on a binge of walking in the UK. I will try to offer some tips based on lessons I have learned.
I doubt this would be of any use to someone raised in the UK. Much of what I would say here would be obvious or second nature.
But lots of things weren&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me as an American and therefore a foreigner unfamiliar with the British countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example right at the outset, compare the words &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo;. In the
US we use the word &amp;ldquo;hike&amp;rdquo; a lot. My impression is that &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo; is rarely used
in England. Instead one refers to &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo;. In America, &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; implies a short ramble. In UK one has the hard-core &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ldwa.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Long Distance Walkers Association&lt;/a&gt;. Their idea of a good time starts
with about 50 miles. Or a more human-scaled example would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walkingenglishman.com/&#34;&gt;The Walking Englishman&lt;/a&gt; web site, a great source
of information. In these notes and tips I will try to use English terminology
(based on my imperfect knowledge) and so I will
refer to &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;hiking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-walking-in-britain&#34;&gt;Why Walking in Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chatting with a local encountered on the top of some barren fell
&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I have been asked why I have come all the way to England to do my walking.
Surely there is plenty of opportunity back in the US. What about the Appalacian Trail? Good question. On a number of multi-mile trudges across boggy moorland I have had plenty of opportunity to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a great infrastructure for walking, both short and long distances.
One frequently see the ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;public footpath&amp;rdquo; finger posts makring some local public right of way. These footpaths originated as actual transportation routes.
There must have been quite a bit of that in colonial New England as well.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the legal and cultural circumstances that caused those rights
of ways to be preserved in the UK. In modern times, the powerful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ramblers.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Ramblers Association&lt;/a&gt; functions exactly like
the National Rifle Association, except for walking rather than guns. The Ramblers
lobby for legislation favorable to walkers and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/pathwatch.aspx&#34;&gt;actively polices&lt;/a&gt; existing
rights of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US hiking routes are associated with wilderness or less desirable land
that is away from populated areas. In the UK, because paths grew out of
transportation routes, they often go from village to village. One consequence
of that is that in the US one has long distance routes such as
the Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail that emphasize being in
the wild and require camping. If wilderness is what you are after, long-settled England is not the place to find it. One might refer to the wild coast of
Cornwall on the South West Coast Path, but one is never very far away from a farm
or a village. One can feel far from the madding crowd in national parks such
as Dartmoor or Exmoor. It does feel a bit wild and isolated. But wilderness is
not the word that describes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an urbanized senior citizen such as myself, the creature comforts available in the UK are a big attraction. Even on the long distance routes one can walk from
village to village and stay in a cozy B&amp;amp;B, pub, or small hotel at the end of the day. One starts the day with a full English breakfast and follows a full day
of walking with a hot shower, a solid evening meal in the local pub, and finally
a comfortable bed (we hope). The type of walking I do in the UK is
fundamentally different from the Appalachian Trail. Plus there are no
bears or mountain lions or rattlesnakes to trouble my calm reflections
during the walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another plus is public transportation, even away from cities and towns. If one wants to do a simple walk, it is often possible to take bus out
somewhere and walk back to your hotel. Here in Connecticut where I live,
there is a very nice set of trails (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails&#34;&gt;Blue Blazed Trails&lt;/a&gt;), but
almost none of them are near bus routes or motels or places to get food.
Invariably one has to drive to trail head. That&amp;rsquo;s true for many foot paths in the UK as well, but there are also many that are available via public transportation.
A couple of times I have decided to cut the day short and catch a bus for
the rest of the trip. Sometimes there are even simple ferries to get you across
an estuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other aspects of the UK that probably make a difference. There is less suburban sprawl and less dependece on cars. In my part of the world one does
not expect to find a motel or hotel anywhere except in a city or near a highway exit. In the UK B&amp;amp;B&amp;rsquo;s and small-scale hotels seem more plentiful. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim the political, cultural, and legal factors that create those differences in
the environment. But the result is good for walkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll mention one other factor: sheep. I like sight lines. I enjoy walking through woods now and again, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so big on a full day of it.
I like to get out in the open and see a long distance. In the American West,
dessert or altitutde clear away the trees and give the hiker an unobstructed
view. I like that kind of walking. In ancient times Britain was covered in
forests. (Well, maybe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/planetearth/stories/608/.&#34;&gt;not completely covered&lt;/a&gt;
In large swatchs of Britain the land is kept clear of trees by grazing animals,
primarily sheep. Sometimes one will see a small stand of trees protected by
an old stone wall enclosing the grove. There are lots of wooded areas in the UK and perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m overstating things a bit.
But I associate areas like North Yorkshire with rolling green hills clear
of trees. In Connecticut a long walk invariably involves a walk in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-walks&#34;&gt;Types of Walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trip I took to England was planned as a car trip around North Yorkshire.
But I quickly realized that if I went to the local tourist information center (TIC) there often was information about some local walks. I ended up doing a
number of half-day walks, including two that lay the ground work for
an enduring interest in walking in Britain. So mixing car touring with
walking is an entirely reasonable way to go. One one trip in Wales I arranged to stay for two nights in each of three places. That often worked out to be
a half day walk on the day I arrived and then a full-day of walking before
staying the second night. I started out with a two days in Wotton-under-Edge and a full-days&amp;rsquo;s walk on the Cotswold Way, two days in St. Davids in Wales and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and then two more nights in the northern half of
Wales. There are lots of areas where one could do something like that. With
a bit of planning, one could do something like that via bus or train as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tour-companies&#34;&gt;Tour Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many companies that arrange walking holidays. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:More-language-is&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:More-language-is&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sherpaexpeditions.com/United-Kingdom&#34;&gt;Sherpa&lt;/a&gt; for a self-guided
tour on the West Highland Way. There are many others. A &amp;ldquo;self-guided&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; tour means that they will organize a route and accomodations, provide you with a map and
directions, and usually also arrange to transport your luggage. Guided tours mean that you walk with a group. The only group tour I have done was an REI tour in the United States walking rim to rim across the Grand Canyon. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have any expertise about organized tours. It&amp;rsquo;s a definite possibility, and well
worth your consideration. Just google &amp;ldquo;walking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;britain&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;England&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Scotland&amp;rdquo; and you will find a lot of options. An organized tour is a good way
to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also walking holidays that are organized out of a particular inn. You stay there for a period of time and each day your hosts arrange transportation to and from a walk for that day. This is not something I have any experience with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-day-walks&#34;&gt;Multi-day Walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the Sherpa-organized walk on the West Highland Way (almost twenty years ago)
I thought to myself that I could arrange that myself. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I have been
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tiny village of
Thwaite I stumbled on a sign for the Pennine Way and ended up walking part way
up Great Shunner Fell, although at the time I had no idea where the
path was leading me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;A &amp;ldquo;fell&amp;rdquo; is a term primarily used in northern England or Scotland for a hill top. Often appears in place names such as Cross Fell.  See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walkingenglishman.com/&#34;&gt;fell running&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:A-fell-is-a-term&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:More-language-is&#34;&gt;More language issues: they say &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; where we say &amp;ldquo;vacation&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:More-language-is&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
